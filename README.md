The program is used to search for the 10 most important transfers in the period selected by the user (1990-2022).
The footballers will be listed in Excel. The sheet is automatically saved. In addition, two charts are generated:
the first chart gives the sum values of the prices of football players in each season,
the second chart sums up the number of transfers in each country.
